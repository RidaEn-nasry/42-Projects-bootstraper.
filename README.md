# Bootsrap your 42 projects.


 This is a small shell script to boostrap the hell out of your projects.
 I just got tired of Repetitive tasks like creating a good folder strurcture, a makefile and re-creating generic tests, like memory errors and othe stuff. (to be included). so i created this small script to automate that junk, I use it for my own projects , so i though sharing with u.
 
 
# USAGE:
  -> ./init-42.sh <project name>
